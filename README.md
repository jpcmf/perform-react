## Anotations 游닇

### Optimizing Performance

#### Memo 游꼴

_When use:_

- Pure Functional Components
- Renders too often
- Re-renders with the same props
- Memo works fine with medium or big size components

#### useMemo 游꼴

_When use:_

- Used to memorize a value, a result
- Heavy calculations
- Referential equality (when we pass information to a child component)

#### useCallback 游꼴

_When use:_

- Used only to memorize a function

#### Data formatting 游꼴

_When use:_

- Used at the time you fetch the information, not the time the information will be displayed

#### Code-Splitting 游꼴

_When use:_

- Used at the time you need to import a file, a component or a function just at the moment we need to use it

#### Virtualization 游꼴

_When use:_

- Allows only items that are visible in the user's browser to be viewed on screen
